### Background

The advancements in sensor technology and ubiquity of connected devices has enabled the generation of large volume of disparate, dynamic and geographically distributed data both by scientific communities and citizens. The socio-technological innovations motivate the concept of smart and connected cities. A smart city is forward-looking and progressive and has the potential to provide high-quality life. A resilient city can preserve its activities and bounce back to its previous stage in the face of an emergency while meeting the daily activities and needs of its citizens. It is imperative to improve our understanding of Resilient and Intelligent Cities in order to leverage these new powerful technologies to tackle the challenges ranging from climate change, public health, traffic congestion, economic growth, to digital divide, social equity, political movements, and cultural conflicts, among others.

The discussion about making a city intelligent and resilient is occurring on two parallel planes. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the difference between smart and resilient cities more so than any other hazard events. For instance, the availability of real-time data and analytics, cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of dashboards and platforms to help with decision-making during this pandemic. Nevertheless, these platforms and dashboards have not been useful in addressing the resilience of the impacted communities as evident from the economic stress that every country is facing around the world. The occurrence of other natural hazards like cyclone Amphan in India or flooding in Michigan due to dam failure during COVID-19 has also brought forth the disconnect between society and technology in this discussion about smart and resilient cities. The challenge now is not only to leverage high performance computing or augmented reality to help with decision making, but also the need to plan and design intelligent cities under the framework of resilience so that online and real-time knowledge discovery from dynamic data streams could be used in conjunction with static data sets to help practitioners and researchers with their policy decisions.

### Program

#### Smart Cities and Internet of Things
Presented by Sokwoo Rhee. 

![SokwooRhee](SokwooRhee photo 2.jpg)

Internet of Things are unleashing an extraordinary cycle of innovation through smart systems in our everyday life. A lot of cities and communities are striving to deploy advanced solutions that can increase productivity, sustainability, and improve the quality of life for residents. This presentation will provide an overview of the structure of smart cities, global trends, and technical issues and challenges. It will also discuss how NIST is working with private sector stakeholders and other U.S. federal agencies to enables cities and communities worldwide to share ideas, develop comprehensive requirements and solutions to their common issues, and leverage their respective investments.

Sokwoo Rhee is Associate Director for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Innovation at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), U.S. Department of Commerce. He is leading smart city and Internet of Things (IoT) innovation programs at NIST, including the Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC) and the Smart Cities and Communities Framework (SCCF) program. He previously served as a Presidential Innovation Fellow on CPS, a program by the White House. His work and achievements have been recognized through multiple awards including MIT Technology Review’s Top Innovators under 35. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT. He is leading the Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC) which aims to create a replicable and scalable model for collaborative incubation and deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) solutions to improve the quality of life in smart cities around the world.


#### Public Private Partnerships: Value Capture in Urban Development
![Wilfred](img/PortraitMaupin.jpg)

By 2050, it is estimated that roughly 70% of the world’s population will live in cities. In an world of high energy climate events, social shocks like SARS, MERS, and COVID, and a need to improve public services and efficient resource-usage there are huge benefits to the effective use of technology in the municipal environments. So why has it been so difficult to deploy technology to improve life and health in the municipal environment. How do public and private entities work together and how do we facilitate value capture in a way that benefits communities while ensuring business incentives are sufficient to encourage investment.

Wilfred Pinfold is the Chief Executive Officer of urban.systems Inc, a company that builds vibrant
communities using technology to facilitate civic engagement, deliver services and share resources.
Before leading urban.systems he had a 23 year career at Intel where he led research and development
programs in Extreme Scale Computing, Internet of Things and Smart Cities. He is a Research Professor in
Computer Science at Portland state University, has taught classes in business, innovation, aeronautics,
ocean systems and has more than 30 years of experience in computational and data science. He is a
member of the City of Portland Technology Oversight committee, holds multiple board positions and is
the Honorary Consul for the United Kingdom in Oregon. He received his Ph.D. in Computational Fluid
Dynamics from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow and attended the Stanford Executive Program.

#### Panel - Smart and Resilient Cities: Where To Go Next?
While research and development activities are being pursued to make cities both smart and resilient, there is still a gap in the discussion how to leverage smart initiatives to make cities resilient to extreme events. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted this gap and brought forth to our notice the need to leverage public-private partnerships, technological advancements, and knowledge gained from research in the area of resilience to discuss what the next generation of resilience research and application should be. The invited panelists will discuss the issue of geo-design and its role in making cities resilient, current standards and policies that enable integration of smart city initiatives and resilience framework, the role of private entities and policy makers in translating research and development activities to policies to ensure stakeholder buy in that will make us achieve the goal of intelligent and resilient cities.

### Objective

Following our success in ARIC 2019, the *3rd International Workshop on Advances on Resilient and Intelligent Cities (ARIC 2020)* will bring together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to address the challenges of integrating computing, analytics, public health research, infrastructure resilience and urban sciences in building intelligent and resilient cities that can withstand the impacts of future pandemics and extreme events. This workshop will provide a platform to discuss research areas and issues in modeling urban design by considering sensor technology, edge computing, interactive visualization, modeling and simulation, and advanced data analytics in the context of the current pandemic and continuing extreme events to prepare for future events and build resilient cities.  Given the need to implement artificial intelligence and real-time analytics on the edge to meet the demands of such cities, this workshop fits the general theme of ACM SIGSPATIAL. 

This year’s workshop invites papers in the following areas:
-	Analytics integrating heterogenous spatio-temporal data for prediction, detection of anomalies and unusual patterns.
-	Real-time analytics of dynamic and distributed data
-	Edge and distributed computing and assess resilience of cyber-physical systems
-	Human dynamics in the Age of Smart/Intelligent Systems
-	Spatial social network analytics in the built environment
-	Theoretical and practical applications of Internet of Things in urban settings 
-	Optimization of sensor locations for urban resilience in the context of design and planning
-	Urban mobility data management and visualization
-	Using augmented reality, simulations and 3D-geovisualization for urban planning and decision making
-	Case studies of successful deployment of smart and resilient cities
-	Policies and theoretical framework for successful deployment of intelligent and resilient cities
-	Existing state-of-the-art and future directions in achieving both smart and resilient cities

Specific attention will be given to papers that focus on resilience (community and infrastructure) in the context of COVID-19, and integrate heterogenous data and real-time computing/analytics/visualization to aid with the pandemic and other co-occurring hazards across the world.
